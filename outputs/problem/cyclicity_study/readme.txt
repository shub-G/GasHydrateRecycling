This folder contains the numerical results for the reference scenario presented in the manuscript "Hidden periodic states in gas hydrate systems lead to spontaneous gas release without external triggers", authored by S. Gupta et al. in 2023.

The reference scenario is characterized by the following parameters:
- sediment permeability K0 = 1.e-16 m^2
- kinetic rate of hydrate phase change kr0 = 1.e-18 mol/(m^2 Pa s)
- sediment burial rate vs = 0.05 cm/kilo-annum

Following profiles are recorded over sediment depth and time:
- Dissolved and solid species: CH4, CO2, CO_3^2-, HCO_3^1-, NH_4^1-, SO_4^2-, Cl^1-, OM(organic-matter)
- Phase saturations: Sg, Sh, Sw
- Pressure, Temperature, and salinity: Pg, Pw, Pc(capillary pressure), T, S(salinity)
- Phase boundaries: Pe (eqb. pressure for free-gas <--> gas-hydrate), Ceq_CH4 (solubility for dissolved-CH4 <--> free-gas), Ceq_HYD (solubility for dissolved-CH4 <--> gas-hydrate)

Figures visualizing the numerical solutions can be generated by running the octave scripts located in the /plots/ folder.
- Use "plot_profiles.m" to generate the cyclic qois and the depth-time evolution of each recorded variable.
